# about methods provided by the DSL, see https://puma.io/puma/Puma/DSL.html.

# Puma starts a configurable number of processes (workers) and each process
# serves each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.

port ENV.fetch('PORT') { 3000 }

# The ideal number of threads per worker depends both on how much time the
# application spends waiting for IO operations and on how much you wish to
# to prioritize throughput over latency.
#
# As a rule of thumb, increasing the number of threads will increase how much
# traffic a given process can handle (throughput), but due to CRuby's
# Global VM Lock (GVL) it has diminishing returns and will degrade the
# response time (latency) of the application.
#
# The default is set to 3 threads as it's deemed a decent compromise between
# throughput and latency for the average Rails application.
#
# Any libraries that use a connection pool or another resource pool should
# be configured to provide at least as many connections as the number of
# threads. This includes Active Record's `pool` parameter in `database.yml`.

# Specifies the number of `workers` to boot in clustered mode.
# Workers are forked web server processes. If using threads and workers together
# the concurrency of the application would be max `threads` * `workers`.
# Workers do not work on JRuby or Windows (both of which do not support
# processes). It defaults to the number of (virtual cores * 2).

# Specifies the `worker_timeout` threshold that Puma will use to wait before
# terminating a worker in development environments.

# Use the `preload_app!` method when specifying a `workers` number.
# This directive tells Puma to first boot the application and load code
# before forking the application. This takes advantage of Copy On Write
# process behavior so workers use less memory.
