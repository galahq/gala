#
# @attr name [String]
# @attr email [String] the unique login for devise
# @attr password [EncryptedString]
# @attr initials [String]
# @attr locale [Iso639_1Code] the reader’s preferred locale
# @attr created_password [Boolean] readers who sign in first with Omniauth will
#   not initially select a password in order to sign in without that provider.
#   If this attribute is false, the user can create a password without providing
#   the password that was randomly generated for their account in the Omniauth
#   callback process. After it has been set, the previous password will need to
#   be provided.

#   notified by email when another reader responds to her comment
# @attr active_community_id [Numeric] the id of the reader’s most recently
