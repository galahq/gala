# Group is our generic stand-in for a “classroom,” which is open to
# non-classroom uses as well. A group connects {Reader}s for discussion in a
# {Community}, with {Forum}s for every {Case} that the group is officially
# studying together. This is the model that is created in response to an LTI
# launch request to group Readers who come from the same course.
