# A deployment is the connection between a {Group} and a {Case}. It’s the model
# on which live any customizations that the instructor wants to make. The most
# significant so far is the pre/post quiz that the instructor has chosen to use.
#
# @attr answers_needed [Numeric] the number of submissions needed from each
#   user. We only handle values 0–2, so far:
#   - 2 means pre and post quizzes
#   - 1 means just a post quiz
#   - 0 means no quiz (and assumes quiz == nil)
# @attr key [String] a random URL safe string used as the hard-to-guess
#   identifier that allows the {MagicLink} to work
#
# @see GenericDeployment GenericDeployment: this model’s null object
