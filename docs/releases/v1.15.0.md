# v1.15.0

This release modernizes our runtime stack (Ruby 3.2.9 + Rails 7.0.8.7),
aligns the Docker dev environment with Heroku-22 (including jemalloc
preload), and lands the first Wikidata-powered authoring helpers while
rolling up a handful of platform-hardening fixes.

## Changes

- Upgrade Ruby to 3.2.9 everywhere (.ruby-version, Docker, CI, Heroku).
- Keep Rails current at 7.0.8.7 to pick up the latest security patches.
- Rebuild the Docker dev image on the Ruby 3.2.9 base and refresh the
  compose image tag so local work matches production.
- Document the heroku-22 target stack in `README.md` / `app.json` and
  ensure the platform stays compatible with Heroku's libc expectations.
- Ship jemalloc by default (Aptfile + entrypoint preload) to reduce
  memory churn across web, worker, and review-app dynos.
- Introduce the new Wikidata authoring workflow (helper text plus the
  integration merge from #759).
- Lock down runtime stats by enforcing role checks on the controller and
  scrubbing obsolete markdown uploads.
- Follow Heroku's keep-alive guidance so long-running HTTP connections
  stay healthy under the new routing stack.
- Update Puma, Sentry, and Rack::Attack config to block abusive clients
  and tighten telemetry pipelines.
- Backfill null checks around expansion URLs (#773) and license config
  URLs (#771) to prevent noisy exceptions.
